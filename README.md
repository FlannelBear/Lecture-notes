# Lecture Notes Repo

This repo will serve as storage for all the markdown notes I take during lectures.  
These notes are meant to supplement the code you write as you follow along.
I will also put dates on all the notes, so you can figure out which videos they correspond with as well.

If you have any suggestions on improving the readability and helpfulness of these notes, let me know and I'll do my best.
